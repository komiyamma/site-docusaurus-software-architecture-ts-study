A modern 2D vector sequence diagram showing a Consumer ACK failure.
Style: Clean line art, geometric, tech editorial style.
Uniform bold outlines, flat colors, no gradients, white background.

Target Audience: Japanese learners.
Text Rendering:
- The image MUST contain specific Japanese text.
- Font should be clean and rounded sans-serif.

Labels to Render:
- Broker: "ブローカー (SQS等)"
- Consumer: "コンシューマー"
- Success: "処理成功！"
- ACK Failed: "ACK失敗（届かない）"
- Message Retry: "再送（重複）"
- ACK Failure Flow: "ACK失敗による重複の流れ"

Visual Details:
Step-by-step sequence: 1. Broker sends a message to Consumer. 2. Consumer processes it successfully (shown with a green check). 3. Consumer tries to send an "ACK" (Acknowledgment) back, but it's hit by a "Red X" and doesn't reach the Broker. 4. Broker, not seeing the ACK, sends the exact same message again labeled "再送（重複）". Very clear and educational diagram.
